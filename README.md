# Pinboard — To-Do Application

## 1 Application Description

A browser-based task manager designed for clarity and control. It helps users capture fleeting thoughts, organize priorities, and stay focused without relying on memory alone. Accessible from any device, the app allows seamless creation, editing, and removal of tasks — keeping your workflow clean and your mind clear.

The software product, **Pinboard**, consists of:
*   **Pinboard-API:** A RESTful backend service built with Java and Spring Boot. It handles all business logic, data persistence, and authentication.
